# Readme

If you have questions about this week's lab, reading, or lecture, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.

## Getting Started Again™

1. Open Jupyter Lab and start a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to download this lab
3. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/extra-credit.git` and hit the enter key
4. This should download a folder to your local machine with the lab (it should be called `extra-credit`)
5. Launch the desired notebook

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Submitting your finished lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you upload your labs. 

1. First, you're going to have to download the notebook to your computer.
    * On JupyterHub, right click on your exercise notebook on your file browser on the left
    * Click **Download** and save it somewhere

2. Then, go to Canvas to upload your lab.
    * In Canvas, click on our class, then Modules
    * Click on the Skills Lab module for this week
    * Click **Submit Assignment** in the top right
    * Choose your Notebook file you downloaded earlier (will end in `.ipynb`)
    * Hit Submit!


Note: you can re-upload your lab as many times as you want before the deadline.
